[![Build Status](https://jenkins.cerner.com/ion/buildStatus/icon?job=Medication Administration/tracing-reporter-js/master)](https://jenkins.cerner.com/ion/job/Medication%20Administration/job/tracing-reporter-js/job/master/)

> This project Builds a viewable tracing report from JsDoc-annotated tests.


## Installation

To use this project, run the following command:
```
npm install --save-dev tracing-reporter-js
```

### Usage:
The report will automatically look for a tracing.config.js file in your project. Optionally it can take a config as a command line argument. After installation, do the following steps to setup the report:

1. Populate tracing.config.js. An example is:

    ```javascript
    module.exports =  {
        reportPath: './tracing/report.md',
        types: {
            'Graybox': 'tests/wdio/**/*.+(js|jsx)',
            'Unit': 'tests/jest/+(components|helpers)/**/*.test.+(js|jsx)'
        },
        issueHost: 'https://jira2.cerner.com/browse/',
        tags: {
            name: 'test',
            issue: 'jira',
            traces: 'traces',
        }
    };
    ```
2. Add an npm script that runs the cli command

    ```javascript
    "scripts": {
        "tracing-report": "tracing-reporter",
    }
    ```

3. Decide if you want to include a Report Viewer in your dev-site. Thee generated markdown file can be viewed in github, but 
    if you want to view this in your terra-dev-site then you need to use either the [MarkdownViewer](./components/markdown-viewer) or [InteractiveViewer](./components/interactive-viewer) component.

### Config options:

##### top-level options
| option | description | default |
| --- | --- | --- |
| reportPath | path to write the report to | 
| types | a key, value object where the key is the name of a "test type" and the value is the glob that matches those test files | 
| matcher | the matching function for parsing the format of tests. Must return the shape { id: Array[String], name: String }.| matches "1000[, 2000] - test name" format
| issueHost | hostname for issue links | 'https://jira2.cerner.com/browse/'
| sortKey | the name of the column that each individual table should sort by. e.g. 'name', 'issue', 'link', 'type'. (sorting tables by 'id' is, effectively, choosing not to sort them and thus they will sort in the order they appear in the code) | 'id' |
| sortDirection | the direction the sortKey option should follow. One of ['ascending', 'descending'] | 'ascending'
| filters | the filtering function all tests are ran through. Return falsy to reject a test. | `() => true`
| tags | lets you specify aliases for tag names e.g. 'jira' instead of 'issue' | see [tags](#tags)
| verbose | outputs verbose logs
| silent | silences all console output


##### tags
| option | description | default |
| --- | --- | --- |
| name | tag for naming the comment block | 'requirement' |
| issue | tag for mapping an issue key | 'issue' |
| traces | tag for mapping a test plan | 'traces |


### Tests will need to be annotated with the tags from the config:

```javascript
    /**
     * @name test
     * @jira ABC-123
     * @traces 1234567 - Verify true equals true
     * @traces 2345678 - Verify true does not equal false
     */
     it('i am a test', () => {
       expect(true).toEqual(true);
       expect(true).not.toEqual(false);
     });
```

### Advanced Usage
The issue tag (or your alias) is applied to every test under it until it detects another issue tag. This lets you group multiple tests in the same block to different issues.

#### example:
```javascript
    /**
     * @name test
     * @jira ABC-123
     * @traces 1234567 - Verify true equals true
     * @traces 2345678 - Verify true does not equal false
     * @jira ABC-234
     * @traces 3456789 - Verify 2+2 = 4
     * @traces 4567890 - Verify 4-2 = 2
     */
    it('i am a test', () => {

    });
```

### Indention
Github's markdown spec only supports a minimal amount of html tags, and all styling is stripped. This makes it difficult to keep the exact whitespace of the test plan as it is typed in the code while also supporting wrapping. Currently the tracing reporter supports indented lists, and the definition of an "indention" is a sequence of 4 spaces. These are replaced with &nbsp; entities in the report. 

#### example:
```javascript
    /**
     * @name test
     * @jira ABC-123
     * @traces 1234567 - Verify this list is formatted
     *     \- I should be singly indented
     *         \- I should be doubly indented
     *     \- I should be singly indented
     */
    it('i am a test', () => {

    });
```

### Notes:
1. The reason the *@name* tag is necessary is because JsDoc by default only parses documentation when it detects definitions of new objects. In the case of mocha and jest tests, a test is not a definition, but actually a function call: *it()*. This means we need to use the @name tag to notify the parser to parse this block when it normally wouldn't.

The InteractiveViewer component is a React component that lets you render an interactive tracing report inside of your dev site. It leverages react-table to allow 
for sorting/grouping/searching functionality across the entire table. **This component relies on the data file that is only produced if you supply a dataPath in the [Config](../docs#config-options)**
